## This is a github profile
I study embedded dev, however I have a special affinity towards java which I used to mod minecraft in the past (and in the future too I hope)
low level stuff are most likely to interest me, as well as apps I need for personal use

I may learn rust someday, but i'm lazy, that's why most of my projects are unfinished
